# Changes from original

* Refactored and rearranged reuseable source files into `foundation` and `gl` for basic system, and OpenGL related.
   - `foundation` directory is grapped from latest iteration of themselves in [haxpor/lazyfoo-sdl2c](https://github.com/haxpor/lazyfoo-sdl2c/tree/master/51_sdlAndModernOpenGL).
   - `gl` will be built over time in this repository.
* optimized `Makefile`
