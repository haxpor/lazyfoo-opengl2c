# Extra

Implemented .DDS texture loader for normal texture (no volume, or cubemap texture) with or without mipmaps.

You can use [crunch](https://github.com/BKcore/crunch-osx) to generate .dds texture (DXT1-5) for you.

Information about DDS specification can be found on Microsoft website [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds).

Extension function to support S3TC texture (so called in OpenGL world) is [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_compression_s3tc.txt).
