# Changes

* Added loading another 2 different ttf fonts. Switching between them by using 1-3 key.
* Calculating width of string also takes into account of margin between character as set within `gl_LFont.c` at the top via `BETWEEN_CHAR_SPACING`.
* Use hexadecimal constant literals to define values in enum `gl_LFont_TextAlignment`.
