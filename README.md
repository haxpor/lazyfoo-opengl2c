# lazyfoo-opengl2c

C implementation of OpenGL tutorial (v.2.1 - 3.0)  by Lazyfoo but with SDL2, improvement and added features if possible.

# Approach

The approach of coding for each tutorial sample will be the same as I did in [lazyfoo-sdl2c](https://github.com/haxpor/lazyfoo-sdl2c) in which each sample directory is self-contained, no reference to external reuseable source file in another directory. But those reuseable source file will be updated / added more features in recent sample directory.

So more recent sample directory has more complete or per say latest source of such reuseable system.

At the end I might combine all those reuseable system spanning in multiple source files together.

# How to build

Execute `make` at the root directory to build all samples.

Execute `make` at each of sample directory to build only for that sample.

As well you can `make clean` at both root, or specific sample directory to clean all built files for all samples or specific sample respectively.
